              Firstly, make sure your headphones are turned on with a single press
              of the top button on the back of the right earbud. Then press and
              hold the power button for 3 seconds to put the headphones into
              pairing mode. Please note that if you connect the headphones for the
              first time, they will automatically turn on immediately in this
              pairing mode. Voice prompts will provide you with additional
              instructions. We recommend that you use the Bose Music app to
              complete the pairing process, however you can also use the Bluetooth
              settings on your device.
